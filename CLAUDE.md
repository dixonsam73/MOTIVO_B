# Études — Working Context

iPhone app: a local-first journal for musicians, with an optional paid
"Études Connected" social layer (Supabase + StoreKit 2 + Sign in with Apple).

Working branch: `feature/solo-connected`. Audit baseline commit: `ec2f52f`.

"MOTIVO" is the legacy working title. The project file, scheme and source
directory are all named MOTIVO; the product is `Etudes.app`, display name
"Études". Renaming is not release work.

Baseline verified at migration: Debug and Release both compile clean
(0 errors). See `docs/audit-findings.md` for what the Release build surfaced.

**Current position: Phase 1 in progress.** Landed and device-verified: C-13
(purchase-path hang), C-24 (reconnect after reinstall), C-1 client half (client
expiry-deletion authority removed), C-2 (Scores survived Erase All).
Verification batch cleared: C-7, C-8, C-19. Filed along the way: C-23, C-25,
C-26, C-27, C-28, from the avatar audit C-33, C-34, C-35 and B-20 (avatar
lifecycle — deletion on erase, and replacement propagation), and C-36 from the
location audit (Solo location published on join, then clobbered).

**`delete_account_v1` is deployed, and QA runs 1 and 2 have both passed.** The
rewrite (`ca00189`) plus the B-20 avatar fix (`5714c53`) carry eight findings.
D5–D9, D11 and D12 ran combined on 2026-08-11, and D13 ran separately the same
day; together they **Resolve B-1, B-3, B-19 and B-20**. D13 is the only run that
proves the avatar fix, because D12's populated `avatar_key` cannot tell the two
implementations apart. Four stay open — B-4 only ever saw the positive
direction, B-9 and B-12 were never executed, and B-13's D10 is deferred for want
of a safe fault-injection path.

**Filed from D13's blast-radius check: B-21, P3.** Two avatars of accounts
deleted in July were permanently orphaned in the bucket — no `auth.users` row, no
directory row, no pointer, and no policy path that could ever reach them. B-20
observed in production rather than argued from source. Both were the developer's
own earlier beta accounts, so no real user's data was involved; cleared manually
2026-08-11. The row is kept as the observed instance behind B-20.

A whole-backend read-only orphan sweep followed, on the reasoning that the old
function ran for months. **Nothing else was left exposed** — zero orphaned
`posts` (B-4's worst case never materialised), zero orphaned shares, follows,
comment views or `attachments` objects; 30 dead `connected_attachments` rows with
no surviving storage. The avatars bucket was the only place with residue, which
is exactly where the audit had no coverage. **One false positive is recorded on
B-8 as a warning:** an orphan heuristic keyed on the `users/<uid>/` path prefix
flags D5's survivor, because the prefix carries the *sender's* uid and a dead
sender is the correct state for a preserved asset. Any future cleanup must read
liveness from `connected_attachments.deleted_at`, never from the path.

`verify_jwt` is now pinned in `supabase/config.toml` — without it the CLI
defaults to `true` and a deploy would silently change the deletion path's
authorisation configuration.

**C-38 is CLOSED as Unverified — a synthetic-only artefact.** The one deliberate
attempt was run on 2026-08-11 and **did not reproduce it.** A fresh Sandbox Apple
Account on device A gave the clean first-purchase state the attempt needed
(`entitlementRead resolved=notEntitled`, confirmed from the trace rather than
from the screen). The purchase went through Apple's sandbox — verified on Apple's
own payment sheet, headed "Sandbox", not the synthetic `[Environment: Xcode]`
sheet — and **the first entitlement read after the verified transaction already
resolved `entitled`**, with `purchaseGuard isEntitled=true`. There was no stale
read at any point. The single synthetic observation stands and is not retracted;
it simply has never occurred on Apple's pipeline in four runs now. Per the agreed
stopping rule, no further hypotheses are manufactured. It reopens only on a real
observation, and QA B2 is where that would surface.

**Note the run method, because it is more useful than TestFlight for this class
of work:** the shared scheme's Run action is already Release, so clearing the
StoreKit configuration in Run → Options gives a development build on real sandbox
StoreKit with the debugger and live console attached. That is a genuine
real-StoreKit environment and it iterates in minutes rather than in TestFlight
processing time. **The Run action must stay on Release** — Debug carries
`com.samueldixon.motivo.dev`, which App Store Connect does not know, so products
return an empty array and you get C-29's signature instead of a purchase.

Next: C-28 and C-35 (both need a product decision first), B-9's QA run and deploy
(the code is committed and undeployed), directory and follow-policy hardening,
zero-dependency cleanup, C-3 measurement, B-6 two-account test. **Plus a standing
release-hardening checkpoint: cut a fresh TestFlight build at the next clean
point and run QA Group B against it.** Sandbox proves the purchase path, not the
artifact beta testers install; C-9 does not close until that runs. Update this
line as work lands.

**Temporary instrumentation: REMOVED.** `ActivationTrace.swift` and all 15 call
sites were deleted on 2026-08-11 the moment C-38 closed, as the standing
condition required. Nothing of it ships. Removal was done by restoring the four
touched files to their pre-instrumentation state rather than by hand-editing the
call sites — no client code had landed in between, so the result is provably
identical to the tree before `402418c`, and Debug and Release both compile clean.

It earned its keep three times over: it produced the healthy activation sequence
(`docs/audit-findings.md`, "Activation path — observed behaviour"), killed two
C-38 hypotheses, re-verified C-24 on real StoreKit, and finally closed C-38
itself — the last of which no screen could have done, since the app sits in Solo
with a live entitlement whenever identity is absent, and "stayed Solo" is the
single observation both the healthy and the broken path produce.

**The `privacy: .public` lesson held.** Every line funnelled through one `emit`,
and every line was readable on device — unlike the previous effort. Reuse the
pattern if release-readable logging is ever needed again.

**One tooling correction for next time:** `log stream --device` no longer exists
on this macOS. The working retrospective route is
`sudo log collect --device-name "<device>"` followed by `log show` on the
archive. Running from Xcode is better still — `Logger` output with
`privacy: .public` appears live in the Xcode console, with no root required.

**Previous temporary instrumentation: removed.** `MembershipTrace.swift` and its
thirteen call sites were deleted once QA B2 passed on real StoreKit, as the
standing condition here required. It earned its keep — it diagnosed C-24,
produced C-1's only device evidence, and framed C-13's verification. One
lesson worth keeping: it was labelled "Release-capable by design" but only ever
read through Xcode, and on TestFlight every line arrived as `<private>`,
because `NSLog` with `%@` arguments is redacted when read from a device. If
release-readable logging is ever needed again, use `os.Logger` with
`privacy: .public`.

## Architectural invariants — FIXED. Do not revisit.

1. **The local journal is never deleted by any Connected or membership action.**
2. **If nobody else can see it, it does not belong on Supabase.**
3. **Reversible decisions may rely on client-side evidence. Irreversible
   decisions require authoritative server-side evidence.**
4. **Personal durability is independent of Connected membership and follows
   Apple's normal backup model.**

Settled after a four-phase client audit and a Supabase backend audit. Only
genuine new evidence contradicting one of them is grounds to reopen — not a
preference for a different design.

`docs/architecture.md` — the four data domains, plus designed-but-parked work.
`docs/audit-findings.md` — finding register (IDs C-n client, B-n backend).
`docs/qa-plan.md` — manual QA, used at each phase gate and for the RC.

## Product principles

These are interaction principles rather than architectural invariants.

- **Reduce ceremony between the musical impulse and the musical record.**
- **Assistance should never override explicit user intent.**
- **Live state is useful; historical state should never become guilt or performance pressure.**
- **Reflection over measurement. Continuity over productivity.**

---

## Settled decisions

- Only sessions the user explicitly shares are uploaded. Solo mode uploads
  nothing. Unsharing deletes the backend post and any storage objects no longer
  required by surviving recipient references.
- Notes and each attachment keep independent privacy controls within a shared
  session. Only explicitly included components upload.
- "Share with followers" defaults ON. This is intentional, chosen from
  TestFlight evidence that the opposite default produced empty feeds. Users
  have a persistent "Default to Private Posts" preference. Copy must describe
  this accurately rather than claiming "private by default" of Connected.
- Client StoreKit governs Études vs Connected (access only). Apple's App Store
  Server Notifications are the sole authority for membership-expiry deletion.
  Explicit user-triggered **Erase All Études Data** remains a valid
  client-initiated destructive action.
- Expiry removes Connected, not the musician. Local journal, Scores, media,
  profile name, avatar, location, instruments, activities, settings and
  preferences all survive untouched.
- Comments a departing member wrote on others' surviving posts are RETAINED.
- Attachments a departing member sent survive for existing recipients. The
  departing member's own received-attachment references are removed. The asset
  itself is removed only when no live recipient reference remains.
- M13 (iPad) and M14 (personal iCloud sync) are deliberately deferred. Their
  absence is not a defect.

## Implementation phases

One phase at a time. Tight scope, green build, explicit verification, reviewed
before moving on. Six bounded, separately reviewable phases — not one rewrite.

1. **Safety** — C-13 first (purchase-path hang); safe `delete_account_v1`;
   directory + follow-policy hardening; remove client expiry-deletion
   authority; Scores erase defect; zero-dependency cleanup; cheap verification
   tests (staged-video measurement, B-6 two-account test).
2. **Durability** — restore Apple backup participation for permanent user
   data, including the reconciliation pass for already-excluded media. Keep
   excluding staging and timer scratch.
3. **Membership authority** — server-side entitlement state; App Store Server
   Notifications; Billing Grace; replay protection; idempotent processing.
4. **Shared-only architecture** — shared-only uploads; remove the accidental
   analytics mirror; purge historic unshared rows; align onboarding, settings
   and App Store privacy disclosures.
5. **Remaining client fixes** — duplicate Score adoption; staged-video work if
   measurement justifies it; playback rate (AttachmentViewerView only, local
   and remote audio/video, discrete 50/75/100%, pitch preserved, no looping,
   no PracticeTimerView changes, no MediaTrimView carry-over, TestFlight soak);
   accessibility and polish.
6. **Cleanup** — obsolete backend code, AVFoundation deprecation sweep,
   architectural leftovers.

Verification gate after each phase. RC QA confirms an already-tested system.

---

## Per-phase working rules

- Restate the agreed scope before proposing any implementation.
- Keep changes strictly within that scope.
- Preserve existing architecture. Prefer subtraction over new abstractions.
- Surface assumptions before making changes; never fill gaps with invented
  behaviour.
- Finish with clear verification steps.
- Verify before asserting. Several audit findings were wrong because behaviour
  was inferred from names and structure rather than checked.

---

## Environment

- iPhone-only (`TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY = 1`), deployment target iOS 18.5.
- Flat source layout via `fileSystemSynchronizedGroups` — everything in
  `MOTIVO/` is auto-included in the app target.
- Debug and Release use different bundle IDs, and **only Release can transact.**
  Debug is `com.samueldixon.motivo.dev`, which App Store Connect does not know,
  so `Product.products(for:)` returns an empty array and you get C-29's
  signature — "Membership options are unavailable", no error beneath it —
  instead of a purchase. The shared scheme's Run action is Release. Keep it
  there.
- **The shared scheme no longer pins a StoreKit configuration** (changed
  2026-08-11). Running from Xcode now gets **real StoreKit against Apple's
  sandbox by default**, which is the inverse of the setting that masked C-9,
  C-29, C-30 and C-38. `Etudes.storekit` is retained but **opt-in only**: attach
  it in Run → Options when synthetic behaviour is deliberately wanted, and
  detach it afterwards. A pinned configuration applies **regardless of build
  configuration**, so it silences real StoreKit in Release too — which is
  exactly how a Release QA pass was once mistaken for real-StoreKit evidence.
- **Preferred StoreKit testing loop**, documented in full in `docs/qa-plan.md`:
  Xcode + Release + StoreKit Configuration **None** + a dedicated Sandbox Apple
  Account, clearing that tester's purchase history in App Store Connect between
  clean-purchase tests. Repeatable, and needs neither new accounts nor a
  subscription lapse — the C-38 attempt waited a day for one.
- **TestFlight is still a required checkpoint before StoreKit work is settled.**
  The sandbox loop proves the purchase path; it does not prove the artifact beta
  testers actually install. Cut a build at the next clean checkpoint and run QA
  Group B against it.
- 193 `#if DEBUG` blocks. Always verify Release as well as Debug.
- Unit test suite is an empty template. "Green build" means compile-clean, not
  test-verified.
- Build: `xcodebuild -project MOTIVO.xcodeproj -scheme MOTIVO -configuration
  {Debug|Release} -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' build`
