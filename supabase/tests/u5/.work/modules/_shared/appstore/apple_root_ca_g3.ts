// Apple Root CA - G3 — the pinned trust anchor for every Apple JWS we verify.
//
// EMBEDDED IN SOURCE, NOT READ FROM DISK, AND THAT IS A REQUIREMENT RATHER THAN
// A PREFERENCE. A Supabase user worker's code is relocated to
// /var/tmp/sb-compile-edge-runtime/ at spawn, so Deno.readTextFile against a
// path sitting beside the source fails with NotFound. Proven at the U4a gate,
// 2026-08-19 — see docs/qa-plan.md, "U4a — GATE RESULT".
//
// THE ROOT PRESENTED IN A PAYLOAD'S x5c[2] IS ATTACKER-SUPPLIED AND IS NEVER
// TRUSTED. Apple's own documentation says to verify the chain against the Apple
// root certificate; it does not say to trust the one the sender attached. This
// constant is the only anchor any verification in this project uses, and the
// U4a battery asserts positively that substituting a different anchor makes a
// genuine payload fail ("intermediate not signed by pinned anchor").
//
// PROVENANCE, recorded so it can be re-checked rather than taken on trust:

// THE CURVES MATTER AND AN ALL-P-256 ASSUMPTION WOULD BE WRONG. Apple's chain is
// P-384 root -> P-384 intermediate, both signed ecdsa-with-SHA384, carrying a
// P-256 leaf whose own certificate is SHA-384 signed while the JWS over it is
// ES256/SHA-256. A verifier that assumes one curve throughout cannot validate
// this chain, and a test fixture built on one curve cannot detect that.
